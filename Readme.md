## My process
-	Using the files provided to me I created a GitHub repo to place everything a set up my webpage
- I linked the style and main.js files to activate the predeveloped code and styling
- I added my updates to the title to reflect the organization of my choosing along with adding images and a video file 
- I also updated the html links and text as well as the social media links
- I choose new serif fonts and a cursive font because it matched my theme well and I knew I wanted to add a quote in creole. A lot of Haitians learn cursive so that is why I wanted a cursive font for my quote
- I add another html page for the founder and removed any unnecessary elements, and update the paragraph and images.  
- I changed the colors in the stylesheet to match my own theme which was based on the organizations logo color. 
- I added border-radius to the buttons to give them a curve, and some shadow as well to make them stand out more
- In my JavaScript code I added a dark mode by providing a theme switcher function to the webpage and used a localStorage to store the users input so it remember their preference and stays their
- I found a great code for my title that would morph the text to spell out the title one word at a time and carefully implemented that into my JavaScript, making sure I did not ruin any previous code. 
- Then I added final touches like removing the second button from the heading image because it caused to much clutter, I adjusted some fonts, added image shadows and fixed some links.
